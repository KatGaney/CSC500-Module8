This repository contains a Python program for an online shopping cart system. It uses object-oriented programming (OOP) principles by defining two classes: ItemToPurchase and ShoppingCart. The program allows users to add, remove, and modify items in the cart, display item descriptions, and calculate and print the total cost of all items.
